      After 7 years in teaching science education, I have now transitioned to the tech industry. Some highlights of my teaching achievements: 
        * successfully cemented interpersonal relationships with students,
        * enhanced department productivity by reducing weekly meetings by 30 mins each time via being prepared with questions, concerns and suggestions ready to go,
        * increased student engagement via feedback from periodic exit slips
        * mentored students in support of successful part-time/summer job applications

      Now as a coding professional, I deliver results by:
        * dissecting the problem systematically & systemically,
        * increasing efficiency of the product/service, 
        * improving existing structure, 
        * maintaining detailed, ongoing communication with team members involved 
      I‚Äôm keen on experimenting new technologies, and am a passionate learner who deeply care about team collaboration, within a work culture that values mentorship, diversity/inclusion and transparency. 
 
      Outside of work, I am an avid and culturally-aware traveller, have lived on 3 different continents and explored 36 countries! This has led me to develop an interest in outdoor activities such as skiing, hiking, camping, as well as an appreciation of international cuisines/cooking, and languages! 
      You will find me conversing in English, Mandarin and Japanese as needed with a side of basic Spanish. During quieter moments, I watercolor paint!
